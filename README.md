# lastFMLookup
This project is based on the LastFM API, and allows to find what are the last 50 tracks of an artist listened by a user. 

For those who don't know it, LastFM is a service that allows to record all the music tracks listened on any device.

We use this project with my friend because we make each other discover a new artist every Friday (we call it #listeningFriday) and it allows us to find what artist the others already know.
