This application is a little web app based on LastFM to find what music my friend listen to.
If you don't know it, LastFM is a music website that offers to record all tracks listened on many devices and softwars. From this data it makes recommandation and it also provide an API to access your data and public data from all users.

I use this website to retrieve the last 50 tracks listened by a LastFM user. Since we are often making eachother discover music with friends, we use this application to know if somebody has already listen to tracks from a given artist.
